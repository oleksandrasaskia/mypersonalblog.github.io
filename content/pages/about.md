Slug: about-me

Hi there, my name is Oleksandra Sopova, and this is my personal blog where I write about things I find interesting, useful and/or unique.

Throughout my career, I have worked both as a Software Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist.
Currently at Microsoft, working on improving Search Relevance and Ranking in Microsoft Core 365 Products.


Previously, I completed the MS degree in CS in the USA under the Fulbright Scholarship and did research on Domain Adaptation in Machine Learning.


During both my studies and career, I have had the privilege to live in 4 different countries on 2 continents: Ukraine (my homeland), USA, Norway, and now Germany.
So I have extensive experience in both studying and working abroad.


Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to get some advice or guidance on your studies, career in big tech, applying ML/DS in your domain, or living abroad!
